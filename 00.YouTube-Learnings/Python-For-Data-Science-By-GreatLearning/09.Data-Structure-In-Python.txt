Data Structures in Python 
=> Tuples 
=> Lists 
=> Dictionary 
=> Set

Tuple
    - ordered collection of elements enclosed within ( )
    - can store heterogeneous (different data type elements)
        Eg: tup1=(1, True, 'John')        #tuple
    - are immutable (values can't be changed/modified)
    - elements are permanent 

List
    - ordered collection of elements enclosed within [ ]
    - are mutable (value can be easily changed/modified, by using their address/index)
    - elements may not permanent 
    - can store heterogeneous (different data type elements)
        Eg: num=[12, 1, 41, 98, 34, 49, 99]

Dictionary
    - unordered collection of key-pair values enclosed within { }
    - are mutable (values can be easily changed/modified)
        Eg: FruitOld={"Mango":200, "Apple":120, "Banana":100, "Guava":80}

Set
    - unordered and unindexed collection of elements enclosed within { }
    - Duplicates are not allowed. 
    - Gets stored in Random Order.
